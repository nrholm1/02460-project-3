    [X] Compute empirical distribution of number of nodes
    [X] Compute empirical distribution of link probability given number of nodes
    [X] Sample number of nodes from empirical distribution
    [X] Compute link probability $r = |E| / N^2$ given the graphs in the training set with N nodes.
    [X] Sample graphs according Generate edges according to the generative model [1. sample N, 2. generate edges]
